# CharlotteOS

The goal of this project is to create a new post Unix operating system with the following key features:

* Ease of use for ordinary users by being a GUI first OS
    Strong access control using capabilites
* A much greater degree of control over their own processes and resources for application developers
* Strong process isolation such that containers or BSD like jails are not necessary


We are actively seeking collaborators who share our vision of building this type of operating system. If you have expertise in OS development or system programming and want to help please join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XPzJtqFVEe).
